What I learned 

1) Using prompt to put a value into a variable returns a string, you need to convert it to a number (if you want a number) using Number() and 2 variables
2) Hover effect (mouseover and mouseout)
3) Manipulating DOM tree, creating elements, then appending it to their parent.
4) addEventListener
